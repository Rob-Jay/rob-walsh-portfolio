# Rob Walsh Portfolio (React + Vite)

Simple, modern one-page portfolio scaffolded for GitHub Pages.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repo named `rob-walsh-homepage` (or update config if different).
2. In `package.json`, replace `<your-github-username>` in `homepage`.
3. In `vite.config.js`, update `base` if your repo name is different.
4. Push your code to GitHub.
5. Run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

6. In GitHub repo settings, ensure Pages is set to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch.

## Personalization checklist

- Replace email in `src/App.jsx`.
- Update the intro and strengths.
- Replace placeholder projects with your real projects.
